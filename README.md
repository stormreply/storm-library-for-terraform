# Storm Library for Terraform (SLT)

The Storm Library for Terraform (SLT) is a collection of GitHubâ„¢ repositories containing Terraform modules.
It serves as a means to easily share and build showcases and good architectural patterns on AWS. It provides
a catalog containing the names and metadata of the repositories contributing to the library, and a set of
reusable workflows to be called by member repositories for common actions.
